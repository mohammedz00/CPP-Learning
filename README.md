# CPP-Learning

## C++, or "C with classes" was created in 1983 at Bell Labs by Bjarne Stroustrup. as a superset of the C language. This is a powerful language which is used in many systems around the world. C++ is heavily used in game development, embedded systems and graphical user interfaces. Unlike C, C++ is object-oriented, which allows for the use of classes and objects.

As someone who does not come from a computing science background, I would like to learn more about lower-level programming concepts using this language. Futhermore, I hope to learn about robotics, and C++ is used widely in that field.
